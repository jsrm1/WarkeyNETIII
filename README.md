# Warkey.NET III - Designed for Windows 10

- High performance code, literally 0% CPU when minimized
- No ads
- Open source!

# Key changes over Warkey.NET II

- Totally recoded whole thing from scratch
- Redesigned with UWP style and natively runs on Windows 10 (.NET 4.6.2)
- Uses keyboard hook instead of spamming GetAsyncKeyState
- Uses Json Serializer and asynchronous methods
- Added auto start and closes with Warcraft III
- Fixed not supporting 4K resolution
- Multi-line autochat support
- More HD inventory image

Some of the parts are hardcoded because applying style seems doesn't work in Windows 10
